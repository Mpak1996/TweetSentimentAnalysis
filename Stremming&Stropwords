Stopword removal: Some words do not contribute much to the machine learning model, so it's good to remove them. A list of stopwords can be defined by the nltk library, or it can be business-specific.


Stemming: Eliminating affixes (circumfixes, suffixes, prefixes, infixes) from a word in order to obtain a word stem. Porter Stemmer is the most widely used technique because it is very fast. Generally, stemming chops off end of the word, and mostly it works fine.
Example: Working -> Work
